## University of Alaska - Fairbanks

MSP430-based microcontroller samples various sensors to monitor the inflation of an inflateable structure. The design project was greatly influenced by a NASA-proposed structure that could be inflated on a lunar or planetary surface after being delivered by a rocket and landing craft or a docking module for the International Space Station.
